### a Sails application

A journaling application written in Javascript using Sails.js, powered by Node, and Angular on the front end. May decide to go with ember when I get there.

## TODO
- Create login process
    - Session storage
    - Authenticated API requests
- Create journal resource
    - Protect access to journals
